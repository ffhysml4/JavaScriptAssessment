# JavaScriptAssessment
What did you like about this project? I have realized that I don't like this project, but it is making me more determined to learn more in-depth about JS. Maybe I don't like because it feels so hard.
What did you struggle with in this project? Everything ...?
What would make your experience with this assessment better? Maybe if I had revised more.
Iffah
